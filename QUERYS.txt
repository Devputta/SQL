Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's  key was broken until after completing the calculation.

Input Format

The EMPLOYEES table is described as follows:                                                                                  Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's  key was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeros removed), and the actual average salary.

Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.:  average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.

Input Format

The EMPLOYEES table is described as follows:

1000<SALARY<10^5                                                                                                                              Samantha computes an average salary of 98.00 The actual average salary is 2159.00 

The resulting error between the two calculations is . 2159.00 -   98.00 Since it is equal to the integer , it does not get rounded up. 


SELECT CEIL(AVG(SALARY) - AVG(REPLACE(SALARY, '0', '')))
AS ERROR
FROM EMPLOYEES;


We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly  SALARY * MONTH worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table.

Then print these values as 2  space-separated integers. 

Input Format
